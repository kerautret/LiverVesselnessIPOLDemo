To propose your own algorithms to be added in the benchmark you can follows the two main steps:

  - Step 1: add a Pull Request you algorithm in the main benchmark repository: https://github.com/JonasLamy/LiverVesselnessDev
    You can read the related papers of ICPR and RRPR to have more details.
    
  - Step 2: submit an issue to request the addition of your algorithms but describibng the main algorthm name and reference.
  
  Once done your algorithm will be included in the online demonstration and be listed here:
